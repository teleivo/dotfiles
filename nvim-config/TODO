# nvim

* add snippets, seems like gopls does not have snippets for me. not sure if any
LSP actually provide snippets
* telescope cycle through via Ctrl-j/k or should I simply learn to use
 Ctrl-p/n? I am used to jumping in snippets using Ctrl-j not sure if that would
 collide. Or be inconsistent, since cycling through completion results is also
 done with Ctrl-p/n
* LSP rename does only work for a current buffer in go. gopls seams to support rename across a workspace
https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/workspace.md so maybe its my client/LSP settup not
recognizing the go module as the workspace?
* remove trailing whitespace via lua function registered in an autocommand?
