# nvim

* test quickfixlist mappings

* telescope cycle through via Ctrl-j/k or should I simply learn to use
 Ctrl-p/n? I am used to jumping in snippets using Ctrl-j not sure if that would
 collide. Or be inconsistent, since cycling through completion results is also
 done with Ctrl-p/n

* remove trailing whitespace via lua function registered in an autocommand?

## LSP

* write LSP diagnostics to location list
https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/1e300671439e156cb2f86452bed2ea9a7c6d64ad/nvim/.config/nvim/plugin/lsp.vim#L21-L24

vim.lsp.diagnostic.set_loclist({ open = false })

does not play nicely with vim-go. As the LSP is currently managed, started by vim-go
Somehow the nvim LSP client does not seem to be properly connected to the same
vim-go LSP.

* enable linting with gopls


## Treesitter

* saving the playground query does not work. I get error buftype not set

## vim-go

* why cant I jump to the location with <cr> in the quickfixlist?
* how can I increase the quickfix list window, for example with go to
  implementation its rather small sometimes

## luasnip

* exercise tune snippet navigation/selection/expansion

* try adding my own snippets

* trying https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/wiki/Nice-Configs#hint-node-type-with-virtual-text
 if I do not fully finish completing the snippet the virt_text remains even
 after deleting the snippet
 is that config helping me in any way? find a snippet I use with a choice
 node. how do I cycle between choice nodes?
