# nvim

* test quickfixlist mappings

* telescope cycle through via Ctrl-j/k or should I simply learn to use
 Ctrl-p/n? I am used to jumping in snippets using Ctrl-j not sure if that would
 collide. Or be inconsistent, since cycling through completion results is also
 done with Ctrl-p/n

* remove trailing whitespace via lua function registered in an autocommand?
https://github.com/mjlbach/defaults.nvim/wiki/Additional-keybinds-and-utility-functions

## nvim-config

* what is the cleanest, most understandable way and maybe vim/nvim best
practices on how to configure language specifics. for example I would like to
configure go things in lua but some configs might be better placed into
after/ftplugin/go.vim ? like autocommands. but if these configs refer to
functions defined in lua its annoying having to jump back and forth between
these 2 files

## LSP

* the diagnostics get updated as virtual text only when I exit using
`jj` or `dd` but not when I exit insert mode with Ctrl-c
or save the file, or the file loses focus which also triggers a write

check events and what autocommands I registered
is the lspconfig registering something by default?
if so what is the write triggering?

* write LSP diagnostics to location list
https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/.dotfiles/blob/1e300671439e156cb2f86452bed2ea9a7c6d64ad/nvim/.config/nvim/plugin/lsp.vim#L21-L24

vim.lsp.diagnostic.set_loclist({ open = false })

* enable linting with golangci-lint. Can I add that information to the LSP diagnostics?

## Treesitter

* saving the playground query does not work. I get error buftype not set

## luasnip

* exercise tune snippet navigation/selection/expansion

* try adding my own snippets
https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/blob/a4c119c8508bf1351bd5150b601eb77826776a2b/doc/luasnip.txt#L376

* trying https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/wiki/Nice-Configs#hint-node-type-with-virtual-text
 if I do not fully finish completing the snippet the virt_text remains even
 after deleting the snippet
 is that config helping me in any way? find a snippet I use with a choice
 node. how do I cycle between choice nodes?
