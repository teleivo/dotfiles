# nvim

* test quickfixlist mappings
* remove trailing whitespace via lua function registered in an autocommand?

## Style

* make a PR in vim-dogrun for diagnostic colors

## Telescope

* telescope cycle through via Ctrl-j/k or should I simply learn to use
 Ctrl-p/n? I am used to jumping in snippets using Ctrl-j not sure if that would
 collide. Or be inconsistent, since cycling through completion results is also
 done with Ctrl-p/n

## nvim-config

* what is the cleanest, most understandable way and maybe vim/nvim best
practices on how to configure language specifics. for example I would like to
configure go things in lua but some configs might be better placed into
after/ftplugin/go.vim ? like autocommands. but if these configs refer to
functions defined in lua its annoying having to jump back and forth between
these 2 files

## LSP

* enable linting with golangci-lint. Can I add that information to the LSP diagnostics?

## Treesitter

* saving the playground query does not work. I get error buftype not set

## luasnip

* exercise tune snippet navigation/selection/expansion
weird behavior: when starting a snippet, every template var I land on
I first am in vim selection mode. Once I type I am in insert mode.
I cannot simply accept the default template var for example the
i in the for i := 0, .. loop and jump to the next var with tab.
I can only jump using tab when in insert mode. However, I can also
not jump in insert mode when the node in question triggers cmp completion.
I then have to add a space to get rid of cmp dropdown and then I can jump
using tab. but that jumbles up the code. there is probably another
way to stop cmp. but either way that all feels very awkward.

* try adding my own snippets

* trying https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip/wiki/Nice-Configs#hint-node-type-with-virtual-text
 if I do not fully finish completing the snippet the virt_text remains even
 after deleting the snippet
 is that config helping me in any way? find a snippet I use with a choice
 node. how do I cycle between choice nodes?
 how to delete the added virtual text if completion fails?

## Java/Dhis2

* how to execute all tests or single test
* get rid of the progress report for starting the LSP
I mean I do like to see when its up/that its not up yet
but it asks for my input and seems stuck if I do not hit enter
this is definitely annoying
* fix build errors reported in nvim lsp.log
* fix 
`language server jdt.ls triggers a register Capability handler despite dynamic Registration set to false. Report upstream, this warning is harmles`
* seems like star imports are used only for static imports like
`import static org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers.*`
how can that be configured in the organizeImports?
* configure the formatter that should be used
